# Nextronic NextTouch

The NextTouch is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32u4. It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, and a ICSP header. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable and get started. 

the ATmega32u4 has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a secondary processor. This allows the NextTouch to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial / COM port. It also has other implications for the behavior of the board.

Using the NextTouch you can make anything into a key just by connecting a few alligator clips. This allows you to hook up all kinds of fun things as an input.
The NextTouch uses high resistance switching to detect when you've made a connection even through materials that aren't very conductive (like leaves, pasta or people).
